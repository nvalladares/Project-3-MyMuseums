Approach
---------------------------------------------
My first objective in creating this app was to build a simple, functioning, attractive app. My second goal was to lay the groundwork for future growth. 

I chose to use Ruby on Rails for my app, because I felt more comfortable with it, and used PostgreSQL as my database layer. After I decided the language for my app, I proceeded to plan out the steps necessary to build the application. I began with looking at sites that met the requirements of the project prompt, and made note of which features I liked and would want to implement in my own work. This lead me to decide my user stories, which are posted on Trello.

Next I moved on to the styling and layout. Once I had an idea of how I wanted my application to look, I proceeded to draw up wireframes, which were followed by ERDs'.  

Once the wireframes and ERDs' were completed, I began to pseudocode my app, to be sure that the user stories and structure of the app would meet all requirements. 

Next was creating the Github repository, generating the new rails app itself and continually comitting changes to the repo.

I plan to continue working on this app and incorporating more features that will hopefully make it a viable product for consumers.

A work in progress...
--------------------------
The Most challenging aspect of this project was figuring out the Google Maps API. I had never implemented a third party API in any of my work, but felt that it would add a layer of functionality that would be appropriate to my app. I would like to continue working on this application, as I feel it could grow to be something viable and marketable.
